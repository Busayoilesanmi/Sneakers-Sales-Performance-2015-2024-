5. Key Observations
Total Revenue: $241M
Total Units Sold: 3M
Male customers contributed the highest revenue, making them the top-performing gender.
Converse Chuck Taylor was the best-selling product with $65M in revenue, followed by New Balance and Adidas Originals.
Sales peaked in 2021 (26.2K units) and 2023 (23K units), with lower performance in 2016 and 2018, revealing seasonal fluctuation.
Grade A products scored highest in performance (88.2), indicating strong customer preference and high quality.
Inventory efficiency was highest for Peanut Butter sneakers (51.97%), suggesting strong alignment between demand and supply.
Limited Edition sneakers generated $142.4M, outperforming regular versions significantly ($64.4M).
Sell-Through Rate: 27.32% across all product lines, signaling moderate product turnover.

6. Recommendations
Focus on Male-Oriented Marketing: Male customers show the highest engagement - target this segment with personalized offers and exclusive drops.
Double Down on Grade A & Limited Editions: These drive the most value - prioritize their production and availability.
Plan for Seasonal Peaks: Optimize stock levels around high-demand years (e.g., 2021, 2023) using historical trend insights.
Discontinue or Improve Lower Grades (D & E): These hurt performance and may drag down inventory efficiency.
Promote Best-Selling Brands: Leverage the popularity of Converse and New Balance through upsells and brand collaborations.
Invest in Peanut Butter-type Sneakers: Their high inventory turnover presents a cost-effective growth opportunity.

7. Limitations
The dataset does not include geographical segmentation or price variations, limiting regional strategy insights.
Customer demographics beyond gender are unavailable, restricting targeted personalization.
External market factors (inflation, competitor trends, social media influence) are not reflected in the data.

8. Conclusion
The Sneakers Sales Dashboard provides valuable insights into revenue performance, product popularity, and inventory efficiency from 2015–2024. The analysis highlights strong consumer preference for premium, male-targeted, and limited-edition sneakers. These insights can inform product design, stock planning, and marketing strategies. The dashboard is fully interactive and business-ready, offering a practical tool for ongoing performance tracking and strategic decision-making.
